# Python-Hangman-game
This program has been made on a raspberry pi 1 model b 2012 using python 3 and the nano text based editor included in the raspberry pi os lite (no desktop variant of raspberry pi os because the desktop variant was too choppy my liking) by Simon Scurtu in September 2024 because he was feeling a little bit bored whilst recovering from a surgery GLHF playing/modifying my game.
